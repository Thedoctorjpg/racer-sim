# 🏎️💥 Racer Sim: Simpsons Hit & Run Chaos on Playdate

Yo dude! 🌺🏍️ Sugar-rush dodger inspired by crankin' thru Springfield traffic on my Shogun—dodge fallin' rocks, chirpin' birds, moo-kickin' cows, stompin' elephants, stretchy giraffes & slithery lizards in a glitchy endless runner. Engine ROARS higher as speed ramps, crash = screen-meltin' TV static hell with layered booms. Pure junk-food-fueled adrenaline!

*(slap your glitch crash screenshot here for max vibe!)*

## 🥤 Gameplay Rush
- **Crank Swerve** — twist up/down to weave thru the madness (clamped to screen edges)  
- **Endless Dodge** — rocks/birds PLUMMET with gravity, ground crew cruises horizontal—speed variations keep it unpredictable  
- **Score Ramp** — every obstacle zipped past = +1, game accelerates wilder (engine pitch SCREAMS!)  
- **Glitch Crash** — eat it? Car smashes (damaged pic), screen SHAKES with scanlines/tears/static, audio sputters → GAME OVER  
- **Animal Symphony** — moos on cow spawn, elephant trumpets, bird chirps, gravel tumbles—feels alive AF  
- **Restart Fresh** — hit **A** for ignition burst + reset chaos
